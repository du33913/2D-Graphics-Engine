## Testing

### Unit Tests

To run/test your code, a few unit tests are supplied:

```shell
$ make
$ ./image -e expected
$ ./tests
$ ./bench
```

A few unit tests are supplied.

```shell
$ make tests
$ ./tests
```

For more details when testing:

```shell
$ make dbench
$ ./dbench
$
$ mkdir diff
$ ./image -e expected -d diff
$ open diff/index.html
$
$ ./tests -v
$ ./bench -m substring-to-match
```

### Images

Assignments also have a set of images that utilize the implemented features.

```shell
$ make image
$ ./image -e expected -v
```
